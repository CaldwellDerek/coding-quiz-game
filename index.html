As soon as you do, the first question will display along with possible answers. You will have 60 seconds to complete the quiz, a timer is displayed in the top right corner to keep track of time. Each wrong answer will deduct the total time that you have. Your score is based off of how much time you have left. At the end, you can save your score along with your initials. A scoreboard is displayed with new and previous highscores! </p>
